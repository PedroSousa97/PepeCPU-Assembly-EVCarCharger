## Project Scope

This project was developed for the Computer Architecture Discipline of University of Madeira, Computer Engineering Course.

The main goal was to develop an Assembly program that simulated the functionality of an Electric Vehicle Charging Point, using a PEPE processor architecture and respective instructions.

The memory bank was used to store: the different displays to be presented to the user; constants; variables; user database; input and output peripherals, including the interface; the stack; and even the instructions in machine code, which represent the Assembly program implemented.

To run this simulation you will need the Java Simulator that I also added to this Repo. Feel free to use it to test my Assembly program, it's super fun!
